An IoT-based Smart Classroom Environment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Problem Statement:** 
A proposal for an IoT-based intelligent environment, with the primary objective of energy optimization and an intelligent, yet reliable attendance system that focuses on reducing latency to give an enhanced learning experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Abstract:**
For a long time, attendance has always been taken manually. This has caused multiple discrepancies and has wasted useful class time.
In addition to this, classroom equipment like fans etc. have occasionally been left on thereby wasting considerable energy.

**Scope:**
We are planning to firstly implement this project in our own campus and then extend it to other institutions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Modules:**
1. Automatic Attendance System
2. Electricity Optimization System
3. Windows Application (Integration of first 2 modules)
4. Database Management System
5. Data Visualization

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Technologies Used:** Finger-print Scanner, PIR Sensors, ESP32, Arduino IDE, Windows Application Development, MySQL, XAMPP, Google Colab
